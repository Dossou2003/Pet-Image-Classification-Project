Pet Image Classification Project
Overview

This project aims to classify pet images using pretrained CNN models and compare these classifications with true identities extracted from filenames. It evaluates the performance of different CNN architectures and provides statistics on classification accuracy.
Features

    Extracts pet labels from image filenames.
    Classifies images using specified CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet, AlexNet).
    Adjusts results to identify if images are classified as dogs or non-dogs.
    Calculates and displays detailed statistics on classification performance.
    Prints summary results including percentages of correct matches and breed classifications.


Install dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Download the required models and data files.

Usage

To classify pet images and view results:

bash

python check_images.py --dir <directory_with_images> --arch <model> --dogfile <dog_names_file>

Replace <directory_with_images>, <model>, and <dog_names_file> with your specific inputs.
