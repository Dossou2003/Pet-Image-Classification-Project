# PROGRAMMER: 
# DATE CREATED:                                  
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Create the function get_pet_labels that creates the pet labels from 
#          the image's filename. This function inputs: 
#           - The Image Folder as image_dir within get_pet_labels function and 
#             as in_arg.dir for the function call within the main function. 
#          This function creates and returns the results dictionary as results_dic
#          within get_pet_labels function and as results within main. 
#          The results_dic dictionary has a 'key' that's the image filename and
#          a 'value' that's a list. This list will contain the following item
#          at index 0 : pet image label (string).
